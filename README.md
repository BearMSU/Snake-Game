# Snake-Game
This is a simple snake game like we used to play on our school graphing calculators and the old school PCs.

It's not fully finished. The game does store and calculate high scores. However, I have not built in anytype of quit function for the game since I set the high score functions for it.
It's a work in progress and I may come back to it and address it later.

This was part of the Python 100-days-of-code Udemy program taught by Dr. Angela.

Enjoy the game!
